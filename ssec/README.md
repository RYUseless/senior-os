# Encryption of data on USB flash drive

## Overview

Create a system for automatic encryption of data on a selected partition of a USB disk. The system 
will provide access to the data based on the identification of the computer to which the USB disk is connected. 
Develop an application in Python language to edit the list of allowed computers and display the history of USB disk connections to computers.
 The application will be part of the operating system for seniors. Publish the results of your work on GitHub repository under the MIT license.

## Features

- Automatically encrypt data on a selected USB disk partition.
- Grant access to encrypted data based on the MAC address of the connected computer.
- Develop a Python application for managing the list of allowed computers and displaying connection history.
- Integrate the application into the operating system for seniors.
- Licensed under the MIT License for open use and modification.

## Installation

### Environment Preparation

Before installing the USB Disk Encryption System, ensure the following environment setup:

1. **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
