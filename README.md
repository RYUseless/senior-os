The system is **under development** and is to be used by the students and academics at Brno University of Technology

- We are developing an operating system suitable for individuals aged 90+ and those with cognitive challenges
- These users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers
- Late elderly and mentally impaired users are also easy targets for cyber criminals
