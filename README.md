# SeniorOS - Operating system for late elderly users

The system is **under development** and the code is to be used only by the **students** at Brno University of Technology.

- Idea is to create an operating system that would be suitable for individuals aged 90+ and those with mental impairments
- These users often face challenges when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers or family members
- Currently, there is no existing system tailored specifically to meet their needs
 
Developed by students at Brno University of Technology via their bachelor’s and master’s theses. Information [Dan Komosny](https://www.vut.cz/en/people/dan-komosny-3065).

## Description

The operating system is built on top of a Linux distribution. It contains an application launcher and three applications: email client, web browser, and text editor. 

- Applications are designed to be user-friendly for seniors and mentally impaired users, with built-in cooperation with their assistant
- Applications also protects users from security risks, as seniors and mentally impaired users are often easy targets
- Operating system is available on a USB stick, allowing users to have the same environment everywhere
