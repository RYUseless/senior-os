# SeniorOS - Operating system for late elderly and cognitive challenged users

The system is **under development**

The code is to be used by the students and academics at Brno University of Technology

- The idea is to develop an operating system suitable for individuals aged 90+ and those with cognitive challenges
- These users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers
- Late elderly and mentally impaired users are easy targets for cyber criminals
