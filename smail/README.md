# SMAIL - Email client for late elderly users

This email client is adapted for seniors in the age group of 90 years and more. 
The developed email client is easy to use and contains only features that a senior may need. 
The implemented audio assistance allows seniors to navigate the application space more easily. 
Additionally, a security measure was implemented to alert the senior when they receive an email message with a link to
a fraudulent site.
